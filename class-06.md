# JavaScript Object Literal
A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

The following demonstrates an example object literal:

var myObject = {
    sProp: 'some string value',
    numProp: 2,
    bProp: false
};
Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, and nested object literals. Here is another object literal example with these property types:

var Swapper = {
    // an array literal
    images: ["smile.gif", "grim.gif", "frown.gif", "bomb.gif"],
    pos: { // nested object literal
        x: 40,
        y: 300
    },
    onSwap: function() { // function
        // code here
    }
};
Object Literal Syntax
Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:

A colon separates property name[1] from value.
A comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
A comma after the last name-value pair is optional.[2]
If any of the syntax rules are broken, such as a missing comma or colon or curly brace, a JavaScript error will be triggered. Browser error messages are helpful in pointing out the general location of object literal syntax errors, but they will not necessarily be completely accurate in pointing out the nature of the error.

Why and How We Use Object Literals
Several JavaScripts from dyn-web use object literals for setup purposes. Object literals enable us to write code that supports lots of features yet still provide a relatively straightforward process for implementers of our code. No need to invoke constructors directly or maintain the correct order of arguments passed to functions. Object literals are also useful for unobtrusive event handling; they can hold the data that would otherwise be passed in function calls from HTML event handler attributes.

There is one drawback: if you are unfamiliar with the syntax, it can be very easy to introduce errors which cause the code to stop working.

## The Document Object Model (DOM) 
connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript, even though modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript language.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.
