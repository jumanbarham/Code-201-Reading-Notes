# Charts
 are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.
Creating a Chart
It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single <canvas> node to render the chart.

In this example, we create a bar chart for a single dataset and render that in our page. You can see all the ways to use Chart.js in the usage documentation.

<canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script>
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
        datasets: [{
            label: '# of Votes',
            data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
            backgroundColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
            ],
            borderColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            yAxes: [{
                ticks: {
                    beginAtZero: true
                }
            }]
        }
    }
});
</script>

## Setting up
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
 

Drawing a line chart
To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page:

<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:

<script>
    var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
</script>
(We can actually pass some options to the chart via the Line method, but we’re going to stick to the data for now to keep it simple.)


Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart. Add this immediately above the line that begins ‘var buyers=’:
### Drawing shapes with canvas
The grid
Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

Drawing rectangles
Unlike SVG, <canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size.

Below is the draw() function from the previous page, but now it is making use of these three functions.

Rectangular shape example
function draw() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas.getContext) {
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    ctx.fillRect(25, 25, 100, 100);
    ctx.clearRect(45, 45, 60, 60);
    ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 50);
  }
}
This example's output is shown below.

Screenshot	Live sample
	
The fillRect() function draws a large black square 100 pixels on each side. The clearRect() function then erases a 60x60 pixel square from the center, and then strokeRect() is called to create a rectangular outline 50x50 pixels within the cleared square.

In upcoming pages we'll see two alternative methods for clearRect(), and we'll also see how to change the color and stroke style of the rendered shapes.

Unlike the path functions we'll see in the next section, all three rectangle functions draw immediately to the canvas.

Drawing paths
Now let's look at paths. A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:

First, you create the path.
Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.
#### Applying styles and colors
Colors
Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).

Note: When you set the strokeStyle and/or fillStyle property, the new value becomes the default for all shapes being drawn from then on. For every shape you want in a different color, you will need to reassign the fillStyle or strokeStyle property.

The valid strings you can enter should, according to the specification, be CSS <color> values. Each of the following examples describe the same color.

// these all set the fillStyle to 'orange'

ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
ctx.fillStyle = '#FFA500';
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(255, 165, 0)';
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 165, 0, 1)';
A fillStyle example
In this example, we once again use two for loops to draw a grid of rectangles, each in a different color. The resulting image should look something like the screenshot. There is nothing too spectacular happening here. We use the two variables i and j to generate a unique RGB color for each square, and only modify the red and green values. The blue channel has a fixed value. By modifying the channels, you can generate all kinds of palettes. By increasing the steps, you can achieve something that looks like the color palettes Photoshop uses.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
      ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +
                       Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ', 0)';
      ctx.fillRect(j * 25, i * 25, 25, 25);
    }
  }
}
##### Drawing text
The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
A fillText example
The text is filled using the current fillStyle.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.fillText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}


A strokeText example
The text is filled using the current strokeStyle.

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  ctx.font = '48px serif';
  ctx.strokeText('Hello world', 10, 50);
}


Styling text
In the examples above we are already making use of the font property to make the text a bit larger than the default size. There are some more properties which let you adjust the way the text gets displayed on the canvas:

font = value
The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.
textAlign = value
Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.
textBaseline = value
Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.
direction = value
Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.
These properties might be familiar to you, if you have worked with CSS before.

The following diagram from the WHATWG demonstrates the various baselines supported by the textBaseline property.The top of the em square is
roughly at the top of the glyphs in a font, the hanging baseline is
where some glyphs like आ are anchored, the middle is half-way
between the top of the em square and the bottom of the em square,
the alphabetic baseline is where characters like Á, ÿ,
f, and Ω are anchored, the ideographic baseline is
where glyphs like 私 and 達 are anchored, and the bottom
of the em square is roughly at the bottom of the glyphs in a
font. The top and bottom of the bounding box can be far from these
baselines, due to glyphs extending far outside the em square.

A textBaseline example
Edit the code below and see your changes update live in the canvas:

ctx.font = '48px serif';
ctx.textBaseline = 'hanging';
ctx.strokeText('Hello world', 0, 100);
